# nats--knative-messaging

NATS messaging enables the exchange of data that is segmented into messages among computer applications and services. 
These messages are addressed by ``` subjects ``` and do not depend on network location. This provides an abstraction 
layer between the application or service and the underlying physical network. Data is encoded and framed as a message and sent by a publisher. 
The message is received, decoded, and processed by one or more subscribers.
